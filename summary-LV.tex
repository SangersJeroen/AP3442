\subsection*{Quantum dots}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item \qa{How can individual electrons be trapped in semiconductor quantum dots?}{Using back gates you can fabricate a confining potential in a two-dimensional electron gas. If this fabricated quantum dot is small enough the charging energy required for a second electron to jump in is smaller than the thermal energy available.}
    \item \qa{What are some common material platforms?}{Common materials are a Gallium-Arsenide and Aluminium-Gallium-Arsenide interface. If the materials have a different bandgap then a two-dimensional electron gas will be formed. Nowadays, they use Silicon or Germanium.}
  \end{enumerate}

  \item \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item \qa{What does the charge stability diagram of a double quantum dot look like?}{For zero inter-dot capacitance it has horizontally en vertically evenly spaced lines. If there is inter-dot capacitance the squares made by the previously straight lines turn in to hexagons due to the presence of an electron in dot A changing the energy level in dot B. The lines are now slanted as well.}
    \item \qa{What physical effects do we see?}{We see the inter-dot capacitances, the number of electrons in each dot, and, the currents for certain gate voltages.}
    \item \qa{How can we measure a charge stability diagram?}{One can measure the current through a third closely placed quantum dot since this dot will also be affected by the number of electrons in the first two quantum dots. Measuring the current through the third quantum dot whilst sweeping the gate voltages of the other two quantum dots allows us to construct the charge stability diagram.}
  \end{enumerate}

  \item \qa{Explain how the state of a single electron spin in a quantum dot can be read out. What experimental conditions need to be met for the read-out to achieve high fidelity?}{Since the energies of spin-up and spin-down electrons are different it is possible to raise the gate voltage of the quantum dot such that one of the spin states is above the Fermi-energy level of the source so that the electron will jump out. This transition can be monitored by looking at the current through a quantum point contact given that we can measure currents in the nano-amperes.}
  \item \qa{Explain two methods for the coherent control of a single electron spin in a quantum dot. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of both. Bonus: explain a third method.}{One way is by using an extra oscillating magnetic perpendicular to the static magnetic field, this oscillating field has a component that couples to the electron spin and causes rabi-oscillations. Another way is by using the electric-dipole interaction, using this method you put an oscillating electric signal on one of the electrodes to pull and push the electron in the well such that it sees an apparent magnetic field that induces rabi-oscillations. The second method makes it easier to address single atoms and allows for all-electrical control. A third way for electrical driving is using a magnetic field gradient from a small magnetic material, this however causes dephasing since the spin is now coupled to the charge.}
  \item \qa{Explain two types of two-qubit gates between single-electron spin qubits in quantum dots. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of both. Bonus: explain a third method.}{You can control the qubits and thus implement gates by either driving electrically by changing the voltage on a gate or you can apply gate voltage pulses. In addition, you can also implement magnetic driving by passing a current through a wire next to the qubits.}
  \item \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item \qa{What are the limiting decoherence mechanism for single-spin qubits in quantum dots?}{The limiting decoherence mechanism is spin dephasing characterised by T2*.}
    \item \qa{How do they impact the fidelity of single-shot readout and of single- and two-qubit gates?}{If the spin state decays before read-out you have no way of knowing what the spin state was.}
    \item \qa{How did the timescales and limiting mechanisms evolve over the years?}{The timescales got longer by 100}$\times$ \textit{twice by eliminating excess nuclear spins in the substrate. T2* times are now up to 250 microsceonds with a pure Silicon-28 substrate.}
    \item \qa{To what extent can dynamical decoupling techniques extend the decoherence times?}{They reduce the coupling between the qubit spin and the nuclear spin of the substrate, this removes the randomness in felt magnetic field.}
    \item \qa{What does this tell us about the decoherence mechanisms?}{That random noise magnetic fields cause decoherence.}
  \end{enumerate}
  \item \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item \qa{What are the limiting energy relaxation mechanisms for single-spin qubits in quantum dots?}{Heisenberg exchange and Ising exchange, in the first the X1X2 and Y1Y2 interaction are taken into account and only mater if the spin-level splitting of both qubits are similar.}
    \item \qa{How do they impact the fidelity of single-shot readout and of single- and two-qubit gates?}{They decrease the fidelity since they allow electron spins to flip and tunnel to the other quantum dots.}
    \item \qa{How did the timescales and limiting mechanisms evolve over the years?}{?}
  \end{enumerate}
  \item \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item \qa{What are the main challenges for scaling up spin qubits in quantum dots?}{Bringing in the control electronic wires to the qubits you want to control.}
    \item \qa{What main ideas exist for overcoming these challenges?}{Big monolithic arrays of qubits.}
